  ABSTRACT = {The Carbon2Chem® project aims to convert exhaust gases from the steel industry into chemicals such as methanol to reduce CO2 emissions. Here, H2 is required for the conversion of CO2 into methanol. Although much effort is put to produce H2 from renewables, the use of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, seems to be fundamental in the short term. For this reason, the development of clean technologies for the processing of natural gas with a low environmental impact has become a topic of utmost importance. In this context, methane pyrolysis has received special attention to produce CO2‐free H2. The conversion of exhaust gases from the steel industry into methanol is a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint via CO2 hydrogenation. Due to the unsteadiness of renewable energies for the required H2 production, other hydrogen sources must be found. Methane pyrolysis appears as a green alternative to meet the hydrogen demand since it provides CO2‐free H2.},

  ABSTRACT = {Upcoming hydrogen economy is on rise on political agenda due to growing need of hydrogen. Natural occurrence of hydrogen cannot satisfy the present need of hydrogen. It produces a wide gap between current hydrogen requirement and amount of hydrogen present in earth. To counter this problem, hydrogen is produced commercially in industries through various methods. Among all these methods, SMR (Steam Methane Reforming) process is considered most feasible for being economically cheap as compared to other methods. Being economical does not necessarily mean being eco-friendly. Industrialist does not switch on alternative methods and continue using SMR process which is producing a devastating impact on atmosphere by increasing the amount of CO2 (carbon dioxide). Greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide makes it one of the primary sources of increasing global warming in earth's atmosphere. Apart of other uses, Hydrogen can also be used as eco-friendly energy source as compared to fossil fuel used as energy source. In this paper, the procedure of production of hydrogen through SMR process is reviewed in detail and its pros and cons are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {The utilization of H2 as fuel is considered as a potential solution for future energy demand, and there has been great interest in the design of metal catalysts for the H2 evolution from water with light and/or electricity over the past years. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (4b) (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous solutions. Photocatalytic H2 production is achieved with a turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H2 production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7. Results from DFT computations indicate that the penta‐coordinated CoII species is the active catalyst in the homogeneous H2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of H2 from a CoII‐H species occurring via mononuclear heterolytic coupling is favorable by –23.0 kcal/mol. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) has been synthesized and characterized. The activities for electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 evolution by Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 were investigated in aqueous solutions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Community water systems (CWS) are facing significant external forces for change from decreasing water-resource availability, stricter water-quality regulations, decreasing levels of federal subsidy, increasing public scrutiny, decreasing financial health, and increasing infrastructure replacement costs. (The Environment Protection Agency defines a community water system as a public water supply service that serves at least 25 people or 15 connections year round.) The combination of these external forces necessitate increasing consolidation responses by small CWS. The results of the consolidation response are significant economy of scale benefits such as the elimination of service duplication and greater buying power through bulk-rate purchasing. However, the consolidation and subsequence operations of small CWS as a regional water system (RWS) requires the development of a method for comparative performance assessment and evaluation that facilitates open and transparent decision making. (A regional water system is defined as a collection of similar CWS that operate under a single governing authority.) The goal of this paper is to propose such a method for comparative PAE for consolidating CWS that operate as a RWS. The objectives of the paper are: (1) to propose a standard efficiency metric (SEM) parameter for the performance assessment of CWS; (2) to propose a standard efficiency comparison metric (SECM) parameter for the summative evaluation of performance that permits benchmarked comparison among CWS; and (3) to demonstrate how the proposed SEM and SECM parameters promote open and transparent decision making within the RWS.},

It is important to convert ethane to useful chemicals. The photocatalytic conversion of ethane is promising but challenging. As the first review article in this area, we summarize the recent important progresses in photocatalytic ethane conversion, with an emphasis on (1) homogeneously functionalization and (2) heterogeneously partial oxidation of ethane. Furthermore, the challenges and future directions are provided for the photocatalytic conversion of ethane.},

  ABSTRACT = {Z-schematic water splitting was successfully demonstrated using metal sulfide photocatalysts that were usually unsuitable for water splitting as single particulate photocatalysts due to photocorrosion. When metal sulfide photocatalysts with a p-type semiconductor character as a H2-evolving photocatalyst were combined with reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 composite as an O2-evolving photocatalyst, water splitting into H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric amount proceeded. In this system, photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 with an n-type semiconductor character transferred to the metal sulfide through a reduced graphene oxide to achieve water splitting. Moreover, this system was active for solar water splitting.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development of an efficient catalytic process that mimics the enzymatic function of alcohol dehydrogenase is critical for using biomass alcohols for both the production of H2 as a chemical energy carrier and fine chemicals under waste-free conditions. Dehydrogenation of alcohol-water mixtures into their corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The conversion of a MeOH-H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content (12{\%} by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand behaves as a chemically 'non-innocent' co-operative ligand.},

  ABSTRACT = {Reduction of acids to molecular hydrogen as a means of storing energy is catalyzed by platinum, but its low abundance and high cost are problematic. Precisely controlled delivery of protons is critical in hydrogenase enzymes in nature that catalyze hydrogen (H(2)) production using earth-abundant metals (iron and nickel). Here, we report that a synthetic nickel complex, [Ni(P(Ph)(2)N(Ph))(2)](BF(4))(2), (P(Ph)(2)N(Ph) = 1,3,6-triphenyl-1-aza-3,6-diphosphacycloheptane), catalyzes the production of H(2) using protonated dimethylformamide as the proton source, with turnover frequencies of 33,000 per second (s(-1)) in dry acetonitrile and 106,000 s(-1) in the presence of 1.2 M of water, at a potential of -1.13 volt (versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple). The mechanistic implications of these remarkably fast catalysts point to a key role of pendant amines that function as proton relays.},

  ABSTRACT = {Metal oxide catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis were created through cathodic electrodeposition and the deposition variables were explored. It was discovered that the use of ammonium electrolytes and higher current densities during deposition improved catalytic kinetic performance for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. A NiFe oxide catalyst was developed with a greater than 99 {\%} ideal charge transfer coefficient for oxygen evolution and a NiV oxide catalyst was developed with a greater than 99.9 {\%} ideal charge transfer coefficient. Combined, the NiFe and NiV catalysts catalyzed water electrolysis at greater than 99 {\%} efficiency below 10 mA/cm2. The NiFe oxide was characterized as being both highly conductive and highly disordered. NiFe, CoFe, and NiCo oxide oxygen evolution catalytic mechanisms were elucidated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The relationship between the charge transfer coefficient of the Butler- Volmer model and the charge transfer resistance of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was empirically demonstrated. The distortions of impedance on non-linear systems was demonstrated and discussed.},
