  abstract	= {The utilization of H2 as fuel is considered as a potential
		  solution for future energy demand, and there has been great
		  interest in the design of metal catalysts for the H2
		  evolution from water with light and/or electricity over the
		  past years. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt
		  complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (4b) (N4‐Py =
		  N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane)
		  was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis,
		  mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical
		  calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both
		  electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous
		  solutions. Photocatalytic H2 production is achieved with a
		  turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H2
		  production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7.
		  Results from DFT computations indicate that the
		  penta‐coordinated CoII species is the active catalyst in
		  the homogeneous H2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of
		  H2 from a CoII‐H species occurring via mononuclear
		  heterolytic coupling is favorable by –23.0 kcal/mol. A

  abstract	= {Upcoming hydrogen economy is on rise on political agenda
		  due to growing need of hydrogen. Natural occurrence of
		  hydrogen cannot satisfy the present need of hydrogen. It
		  produces a wide gap between current hydrogen requirement
		  and amount of hydrogen present in earth. To counter this
		  problem, hydrogen is produced commercially in industries
		  through various methods. Among all these methods, SMR
		  (Steam Methane Reforming) process is considered most
		  feasible for being economically cheap as compared to other
		  methods. Being economical does not necessarily mean being

		  devastating impact on atmosphere by increasing the amount

		  comparisons of technologies and infrastructural
		  requirements, and quantitative comparisons of the lifecycle

		  accounting for capital and fuel costs. A common vehicle
		  platform is assumed. The 2030 scenario is discussed and
		  compared to a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal
		  combustion engine (ICE) powertrain. A comprehensive
		  sensitivity analysis shows that in 2030 FCEVs could achieve
		  lifecycle cost parity with conventional gasoline vehicles.
		  However, both the BEV and FCHEV have significantly lower
		  lifecycle costs. In the 2030 scenario, powertrain lifecycle
		  costs of FCEVs range from {\$}7360 to {\$}22,580, whereas
		  those for BEVs range from {\$}6460 to {\$}11,420 and

		  cost. The BEV and FCHEV are relatively insensitive to
