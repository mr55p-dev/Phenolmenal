  abstract	= {Methane steam reforming (MSR) is the most common and
		  cost-effective method for hydrogen production, and it
		  contributes about 50{\%} of the world's hydrogen
		  production. Although MSR is a mature technology, it suffers
		  from significant disadvantages such as mass and heat
		  transfer issues and coke deposition during the reaction.
		  Industrially, the MSR reaction is carried out in
		  conventional reactors (CRs) and, in order to obtain a
		  highly pure hydrogen stream, several steps are necessary,
		  such as the reduction of carbon monoxide content in the
		  reformate stream by water gas shift reactors, pressure
		  swing adsorption, and further hydrogen
		  separation/purification devices. Therefore, in order to
		  intensify the whole process, a membrane reactor can be used
		  as alternative solution to conventional systems. In
		  particular, the use of a hydrogen perm-selective membrane
		  inside of a reactor allows the combination of the chemical
		  reaction and hydrogen separation in only one tool. As a
		  result, high-purity hydrogen, methane conversion, and
		  hydrogen production enhancement are obtained as well as the
		  possibility to perform the MSR reaction at milder operating
		  conditions than CRs. Therefore, in this chapter, the
		  relevant progress achieved so far, the most relevant topics
		  of MSR via membrane reactor technology, and the effects of
		  the most important parameters affecting MSR in membrane
		  reactors are described and critically reviewed. In
		  addition, an overview on the mathematical models used for
		  simulating the MSR reaction in a membrane reactor is also
		  presented and discussed.},

  abstract	= {The characteristics of carbon monoxide conversion and
		  hydrogen generation from a water gas shift reaction (WGSR)
		  are investigated experimentally. Particular emphasis is
		  placed on the performance of the reaction affected by
		  various operational conditions. The important parameters
		  include the catalyst type, residence time of reactants in a
		  catalyst bed, reaction temperature and CO/steam ratio. Two
		  different catalysts, consist of a high-temperature catalyst
		  (HTC) and a low-temperature catalyst (LTC), are taken into
		  consideration. The experiments indicate that when the
		  residence time is as long as 0.09 s, the WGSR develops
		  well, no matter which catalyst is used. With the effect of
		  the HTC, increasing reaction temperature will promote the
		  performance of the WGSR. Alternatively, for the LTC, the
		  reaction will not be excited if the reaction temperature is
		  below 200 °C. Once the temperature reaches 200 °C the
		  reaction occurs, but the CO conversion decreases with
		  increasing temperature. These behaviors reveal that the
		  water gas shift reactions with the HTC and the LTC are
		  governed by chemical kinetics and thermodynamic
		  equilibrium, respectively. It is of interest that water
		  decomposition also develops in the WGSR so that the
		  concentration of H2 is always higher than that of CO2 a
		  bit. With regard to the CO/steam ratio, the CO conversion
		  will be enhanced if the ratio is decreased. However, the
		  performance of the WGSR is insensitive to the variation of
		  the ratio if it is smaller than 1/4. {\textcopyright} 2008

  abstract	= {Hydrogen is mostly produced by the Steam Methane Reforming
		  (SMR) reaction which adds many tonnes of carbon emissions
		  to the environment for each tonne of hydrogen. A modified
		  scheme for carbon-emission free production of hydrogen,
		  which involves sodium hydroxide, methane and steam, has
		  been explored here. The modification of the SMR reaction is
		  CH4 + 2NaOH + H2O = Na2CO3 + 4H2 The modified
		  reaction has several advantages: it does not require
		  catalysis, the temperature of reaction is considerably
		  reduced and the products are industrially important. By
		  this process, we can produce hydrogen without any carbon
		  dioxide emission as shown in this theoretical and
		  experimental study. The reaction has been studied in the
		  temperature range of 873–1073 K in an open configuration
		  for 30 min and at various methane and constant water vapor
		  flow. It is determined that at a methane flow rate of

  abstract	= {Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the easiest methods
		  for hydrogen production, offering the advantage of
		  simplicity. The challenges for widespread use of water
		  electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and
		  maintenance and to increase reliability, durability and
		  safety. This literature review examines the current state
		  of knowledge and technology of hydrogen production by water
		  electrolysis and identifies areas where R{\&}D effort is
		  needed in order to improve this technology. Following an
		  overview of the fundamentals of alkaline water
		  electrolysis, an electrical circuit analogy of resistances
		  in the electrolysis system is introduced. The resistances
		  are classified into three categories, namely the electrical
		  resistances, the reaction resistances and the transport
		  resistances. This is followed by a thorough analysis of
		  each of the resistances, by means of thermodynamics and
		  kinetics, to provide a scientific guidance to minimising
		  the resistance in order to achieve a greater efficiency of
		  alkaline water electrolysis. The thermodynamic analysis
		  defines various electrolysis efficiencies based on
		  theoretical energy input and cell voltage, respectively.
		  These efficiencies are then employed to compare different
		  electrolysis cell designs and to identify the means to
		  overcome the key resistances for efficiency improvement.
		  The kinetic analysis reveals the dependence of reaction
		  resistances on the alkaline concentration, ion transfer,
		  and reaction sites on the electrode surface, the latter is
		  determined by the electrode materials. A quantitative
		  relationship between the cell voltage components and
		  current density is established, which links all the
		  resistances and manifests the importance of reaction
		  resistances and bubble resistances. The important effect of
		  gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface and the need to
		  minimise the ion transport resistance are highlighted. The
		  historical development and continuous improvement in the
		  alkaline water electrolysis technology are examined and
		  different water electrolysis technologies are
		  systematically compared using a set of the practical
		  parameters derived from the thermodynamic and kinetic
		  analyses. In addition to the efficiency improvements, the
		  needs for reduction in equipment and maintenance costs, and
		  improvement in reliability and durability are also
		  established. The future research needs are also discussed
		  from the aspects of electrode materials, electrolyte
		  additives and bubble management, serving as a comprehensive
		  guide for continuous development of the water electrolysis
		  technology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
