abstract = {The utilization of H2 as fuel is considered as a potential solution for future energy demand, and there has been great interest in the design of metal catalysts for the H2 evolution from water with light and/or electricity over the past years. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (4b) (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous solutions. Photocatalytic H2 production is achieved with a turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H2 production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7. Results from DFT computations indicate that the penta‐coordinated CoII species is the active catalyst in the homogeneous H2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of H2 from a CoII‐H species occurring via mononuclear heterolytic coupling is favorable by –23.0 kcal/mol.
