abstract = {The Carbon2Chem{\textregistered} project aims to convert exhaust gases from the steel industry into chemicals such as methanol to reduce CO2 emissions. Here, H2 is required for the conversion of CO2 into methanol. Although much effort is put to produce H2 from renewables, the use of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, seems to be fundamental in the short term. For this reason, the development of clean technologies for the processing of natural gas with a low environmental impact has become a topic of utmost importance. In this context, methane pyrolysis has received special attention to produce CO2‐free H2. The conversion of exhaust gases from the steel industry into methanol is a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint via CO2 hydrogenation. Due to the unsteadiness of renewable energies for the required H2 production, other hydrogen sources must be found. Methane pyrolysis appears as a green alternative to meet the hydrogen demand since it provides CO2‐free H2.},

abstract = {The utilization of H2 as fuel is considered as a potential solution for future energy demand, and there has been great interest in the design of metal catalysts for the H2 evolution from water with light and/or electricity over the past years. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (4b) (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous solutions. Photocatalytic H2 production is achieved with a turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H2 production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7. Results from DFT computations indicate that the penta‐coordinated CoII species is the active catalyst in the homogeneous H2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of H2 from a CoII‐H species occurring via mononuclear heterolytic coupling is favorable by –23.0 kcal/mol. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) has been synthesized and characterized.

Among all these methods, SMR (Steam Methane Reforming) process is considered most feasible for being economically cheap as compared to other methods. Being economical does not necessarily mean being eco-friendly. Industrialist does not switch on alternative methods and continue using SMR process which is producing a devastating impact on atmosphere by increasing the amount of CO2 (carbon dioxide). Greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide makes it one of the primary sources of increasing global warming in earth's atmosphere. Apart of other uses, Hydrogen can also be used as eco-friendly energy source as compared to fossil fuel used as energy source.

Dehydrogenation of alcohol-water mixtures into their corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The conversion of a MeOH-H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content (12{\%} by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand behaves as a chemically 'non-innocent' co-operative ligand.},

By this process, we can produce hydrogen without any carbon dioxide emission as shown in this theoretical and experimental study.

Qualitative comparisons of technologies and infrastructural requirements, and quantitative comparisons of the lifecycle cost of the powertrain over 100,000 mile are undertaken, accounting for capital and fuel costs. A common vehicle platform is assumed. The 2030 scenario is discussed and compared to a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that in 2030 FCEVs could achieve lifecycle cost parity with conventional gasoline vehicles. However, both the BEV and FCHEV have significantly lower lifecycle costs. In the 2030 scenario, powertrain lifecycle costs of FCEVs range from {\$}7360 to {\$}22,580, whereas those for BEVs range from {\$}6460 to {\$}11,420 and FCHEVs, from {\$}4310 to {\$}12,540. All vehicle platforms exhibit significant cost sensitivity to powertrain capital cost. The BEV and FCHEV are relatively insensitive to electricity costs but the FCHEV and FCV are sensitive to hydrogen cost. The BEV and FCHEV are reasonably similar in lifecycle cost and one may offer an advantage over the other depending on driving patterns. A key conclusion is that the best path for future development of FCEVs is the FCHEV. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The characteristics of carbon monoxide conversion and hydrogen generation from a water gas shift reaction (WGSR) are investigated experimentally. Particular emphasis is placed on the performance of the reaction affected by various operational conditions. The important parameters include the catalyst type, residence time of reactants in a catalyst bed, reaction temperature and CO/steam ratio. Two different catalysts, consist of a high-temperature catalyst (HTC) and a low-temperature catalyst (LTC), are taken into consideration. The experiments indicate that when the residence time is as long as 0.09 s, the WGSR develops well, no matter which catalyst is used. With the effect of the HTC, increasing reaction temperature will promote the performance of the WGSR. Alternatively, for the LTC, the reaction will not be excited if the reaction temperature is below 200 °C. Once the temperature reaches 200 °C the reaction occurs, but the CO conversion decreases with increasing temperature. These behaviors reveal that the water gas shift reactions with the HTC and the LTC are governed by chemical kinetics and thermodynamic equilibrium, respectively. It is of interest that water decomposition also develops in the WGSR so that the concentration of H2 is always higher than that of CO2 a bit. With regard to the CO/steam ratio, the CO conversion will be enhanced if the ratio is decreased. However, the performance of the WGSR is insensitive to the variation of the ratio if it is smaller than 1/4. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Methane steam reforming (MSR) is the most common and cost-effective method for hydrogen production, and it contributes about 50{\%} of the world's hydrogen production. Although MSR is a mature technology, it suffers from significant disadvantages such as mass and heat transfer issues and coke deposition during the reaction. Industrially, the MSR reaction is carried out in conventional reactors (CRs) and, in order to obtain a highly pure hydrogen stream, several steps are necessary, such as the reduction of carbon monoxide content in the reformate stream by water gas shift reactors, pressure swing adsorption, and further hydrogen separation/purification devices. Therefore, in order to intensify the whole process, a membrane reactor can be used as alternative solution to conventional systems. In particular, the use of a hydrogen perm-selective membrane inside of a reactor allows the combination of the chemical reaction and hydrogen separation in only one tool. As a result, high-purity hydrogen, methane conversion, and hydrogen production enhancement are obtained as well as the possibility to perform the MSR reaction at milder operating conditions than CRs. Therefore, in this chapter, the relevant progress achieved so far, the most relevant topics of MSR via membrane reactor technology, and the effects of the most important parameters affecting MSR in membrane reactors are described and critically reviewed. In addition, an overview on the mathematical models used for simulating the MSR reaction in a membrane reactor is also presented and discussed.},
