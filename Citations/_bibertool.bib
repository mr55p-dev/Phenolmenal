  ABSTRACT = {Methane steam reforming (MSR) is the most common and cost-effective method for hydrogen production, and it contributes about 50{\%} of the world's hydrogen production. Although MSR is a mature technology, it suffers from significant disadvantages such as mass and heat transfer issues and coke deposition during the reaction. Industrially, the MSR reaction is carried out in conventional reactors (CRs) and, in order to obtain a highly pure hydrogen stream, several steps are necessary, such as the reduction of carbon monoxide content in the reformate stream by water gas shift reactors, pressure swing adsorption, and further hydrogen separation/purification devices. Therefore, in order to intensify the whole process, a membrane reactor can be used as alternative solution to conventional systems. In particular, the use of a hydrogen perm-selective membrane inside of a reactor allows the combination of the chemical reaction and hydrogen separation in only one tool. As a result, high-purity hydrogen, methane conversion, and hydrogen production enhancement are obtained as well as the possibility to perform the MSR reaction at milder operating conditions than CRs. Therefore, in this chapter, the relevant progress achieved so far, the most relevant topics of MSR via membrane reactor technology, and the effects of the most important parameters affecting MSR in membrane reactors are described and critically reviewed. In addition, an overview on the mathematical models used for simulating the MSR reaction in a membrane reactor is also presented and discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {The characteristics of carbon monoxide conversion and hydrogen generation from a water gas shift reaction (WGSR) are investigated experimentally. Particular emphasis is placed on the performance of the reaction affected by various operational conditions. The important parameters include the catalyst type, residence time of reactants in a catalyst bed, reaction temperature and CO/steam ratio. Two different catalysts, consist of a high-temperature catalyst (HTC) and a low-temperature catalyst (LTC), are taken into consideration. The experiments indicate that when the residence time is as long as 0.09 s, the WGSR develops well, no matter which catalyst is used. With the effect of the HTC, increasing reaction temperature will promote the performance of the WGSR. Alternatively, for the LTC, the reaction will not be excited if the reaction temperature is below 200 °C. Once the temperature reaches 200 °C the reaction occurs, but the CO conversion decreases with increasing temperature. These behaviors reveal that the water gas shift reactions with the HTC and the LTC are governed by chemical kinetics and thermodynamic equilibrium, respectively. It is of interest that water decomposition also develops in the WGSR so that the concentration of H2 is always higher than that of CO2 a bit. With regard to the CO/steam ratio, the CO conversion will be enhanced if the ratio is decreased. However, the performance of the WGSR is insensitive to the variation of the ratio if it is smaller than 1/4. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {The utilization of H2 as fuel is considered as a potential solution for future energy demand, and there has been great interest in the design of metal catalysts for the H2 evolution from water with light and/or electricity over the past years. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (4b) (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, mass spectrum, electrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. It is shown that 4b can catalyze both electro‐ and photocatalytic H2 production in aqueous solutions. Photocatalytic H2 production is achieved with a turnover number (TON) of 200 at pH 6 while electrolytic H2 production is accomplished with a TON of 140 at pH 7. Results from DFT computations indicate that the penta‐coordinated CoII species is the active catalyst in the homogeneous H2 evolution by 4b, and the generation of H2 from a CoII‐H species occurring via mononuclear heterolytic coupling is favorable by –23.0 kcal/mol. A mononuclear water soluble polypyridyl cobalt complex [Co(N4‐Py)(H2O)](PF6)3 (N4‐Py = N‐methylpyridine‐2,11‐diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane) has been synthesized and characterized.

  ABSTRACT = {To reduce the energy consumption of the electrolytic hydrogen generation process, we propose a novel approach to generate hydrogen with acidic/alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis, wherein hydrogen is produced inside an acidic solution and oxygen evolved under alkaline condition, and a membrane is employed in the middle of the electrolyzer to restrain neutralization. The electrode polarization is greatly reduced due to the specific arrangement of the acidic/alkaline amphoteric electrolyzer. The rate of hydrogen production achieves over four times higher than that of the alkaline aqueous solution at 2.2 V, and the energy consumption is reduced approximately 30{\%} under the current density of 200 mA/cm2. The investigation of transmembrane potential drop indicates water splitting on the membrane surfaces, which compensates for acid or alkaline loss on-site and maintains the concentration approximately constant during electrolysis process. The acidic/alkaline amphoteric water electrolysis is promising as an energy saving, clean and sustainable hydrogen production technology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Nanoporous oxides (SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, and AlOOH) synthesized from sol–gel chemistry techniques were used as coatings for stainless steel electrodes in water electrolysis systems. These oxide coatings have been shown to provide corrosion protection of the stainless steel electrodes at potentials positive enough to evolve oxygen on the positive electrode. In addition, all four oxide coated electrodes showed a 100–200 mV lower overpotential for hydrogen evolution than an uncoated stainless steel electrode. This was attributed to the ability of the oxide coatings to adsorb hydrogen on the surface of the electrode. To verify gas production from these electrodes, a custom alkaline electrolyzer was built and tested with a constant applied current. The flow rate of gas was measured for five different electrode connection configurations, utilizing both monopolar and bipolar electrodes. The efficiency of the system was calculated to be between 66 and 75{\%} as defined as the ratio of the higher heating value of hydrogen to the energy applied to the system. The oxide coated stainless steel electrodes were used without any additional catalysts, including the precious metals.},

  ABSTRACT = {Upcoming hydrogen economy is on rise on political agenda due to growing need of hydrogen. Natural occurrence of hydrogen cannot satisfy the present need of hydrogen. It produces a wide gap between current hydrogen requirement and amount of hydrogen present in earth. To counter this problem, hydrogen is produced commercially in industries through various methods. Among all these methods, SMR (Steam Methane Reforming) process is considered most feasible for being economically cheap as compared to other methods. Being economical does not necessarily mean being eco-friendly. Industrialist does not switch on alternative methods and continue using SMR process which is producing a devastating impact on atmosphere by increasing the amount of CO2 (carbon dioxide). Greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide makes it one of the primary sources of increasing global warming in earth's atmosphere. Apart of other uses, Hydrogen can also be used as eco-friendly energy source as compared to fossil fuel used as energy source. In this paper, the procedure of production of hydrogen through SMR process is reviewed in detail and its pros and cons are discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper compares battery electric vehicles (BEV) to hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) and hydrogen fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles (FCHEV). Qualitative comparisons of technologies and infrastructural requirements, and quantitative comparisons of the lifecycle cost of the powertrain over 100,000 mile are undertaken, accounting for capital and fuel costs. A common vehicle platform is assumed. The 2030 scenario is discussed and compared to a conventional gasoline-fuelled internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that in 2030 FCEVs could achieve lifecycle cost parity with conventional gasoline vehicles. However, both the BEV and FCHEV have significantly lower lifecycle costs. In the 2030 scenario, powertrain lifecycle costs of FCEVs range from {\$}7360 to {\$}22,580, whereas those for BEVs range from {\$}6460 to {\$}11,420 and FCHEVs, from {\$}4310 to {\$}12,540. All vehicle platforms exhibit significant cost sensitivity to powertrain capital cost. The BEV and FCHEV are relatively insensitive to electricity costs but the FCHEV and FCV are sensitive to hydrogen cost. The BEV and FCHEV are reasonably similar in lifecycle cost and one may offer an advantage over the other depending on driving patterns. A key conclusion is that the best path for future development of FCEVs is the FCHEV. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the context of the current serious problems related to energy demand and climate change, substantial progress has been made in developing a sustainable energy system. Electrochemical hydrogen–water conversion is an ideal energy system that can produce fuels via sustainable, fossil-free pathways. However, the energy conversion efficiency of two functioning technologies in this energy system—namely, water electrolysis and the fuel cell—still has great scope for improvement. This review analyzes the energy dissipation of water electrolysis and the fuel cell in the hydrogen–water energy system and discusses the key barriers in the hydrogen- and oxygen-involving reactions that occur on the catalyst surface. By means of the scaling relations between reactive intermediates and their apparent catalytic performance, this article summarizes the frameworks of the catalytic activity trends, providing insights into the design of highly active electrocatalysts for the involved reactions. A series of structural engineering methodologies (including nanoarchitecture, facet engineering, polymorph engineering, amorphization, defect engineering, element doping, interface engineering, and alloying) and their applications based on catalytic performance are then introduced, with an emphasis on the rational guidance from previous theoretical and experimental studies. The key scientific problems in the electrochemical hydrogen–water conversion system are outlined, and future directions are proposed for developing advanced catalysts for technologies with high energy-conversion efficiency.},

  ABSTRACT = {The development of an efficient catalytic process that mimics the enzymatic function of alcohol dehydrogenase is critical for using biomass alcohols for both the production of H2 as a chemical energy carrier and fine chemicals under waste-free conditions. Dehydrogenation of alcohol-water mixtures into their corresponding acids with molecular hydrogen as the sole by-product from the reaction can be catalysed by a ruthenium complex with a chelating bis(olefin) diazadiene ligand. This complex, [K(dme)2][Ru(H)(trop2dad)], stores up to two equivalents of hydrogen intramolecularly, and catalyses the production of H2 from alcohols in the presence of water and a base under homogeneous conditions. The conversion of a MeOH-H2O mixture proceeds selectively to CO2/H2 gas formation under neutral conditions, thereby allowing the use of the entire hydrogen content (12{\%} by weight). Isolation and characterization of the ruthenium complexes from these reactions suggested a mechanistic scenario in which the trop2dad ligand behaves as a chemically 'non-innocent' co-operative ligand.},

  ABSTRACT = {Hydrogen is mostly produced by the Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) reaction which adds many tonnes of carbon emissions to the environment for each tonne of hydrogen. A modified scheme for carbon-emission free production of hydrogen, which involves sodium hydroxide, methane and steam, has been explored here. The modification of the SMR reaction is CH4 + 2NaOH + H2O = Na2CO3 + 4H2 The modified reaction has several advantages: it does not require catalysis, the temperature of reaction is considerably reduced and the products are industrially important. By this process, we can produce hydrogen without any carbon dioxide emission as shown in this theoretical and experimental study. The reaction has been studied in the temperature range of 873–1073 K in an open configuration for 30 min and at various methane and constant water vapor flow. It is determined that at a methane flow rate of 25 ml/min the reaction is 98{\%} complete at 873 K.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Carbon2Chem® project aims to convert exhaust gases from the steel industry into chemicals such as methanol to reduce CO2 emissions. Here, H2 is required for the conversion of CO2 into methanol. Although much effort is put to produce H2 from renewables, the use of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, seems to be fundamental in the short term. For this reason, the development of clean technologies for the processing of natural gas with a low environmental impact has become a topic of utmost importance. In this context, methane pyrolysis has received special attention to produce CO2‐free H2. The conversion of exhaust gases from the steel industry into methanol is a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint via CO2 hydrogenation. Due to the unsteadiness of renewable energies for the required H2 production, other hydrogen sources must be found. Methane pyrolysis appears as a green alternative to meet the hydrogen demand since it provides CO2‐free H2.},

  ABSTRACT = {Water electrolysis is considered as a suitable pathway for the production of large amounts of hydrogen to be used as energy carrier for electricity storage. Among the existing water electrolysis technologies solid oxide steam electrolysis exhibits the highest electrical efficiency. Moreover, from thermodynamic considerations the efficiency can be further increased when part of the energy demand is provided by the integration of external high temperature heat to reduce the electrical energy for the water splitting reaction. This paper reports on the successful integration of solar heat into a solid oxide electrolyzer. The experimental setup of the prototype system consisting of a solar simulator, a solar steam generator, a steam accumulator and a solid oxide electrolyzer as well as first results with regard to solar steam generation and electrochemical performance of the electrolyzer are presented. Hot steam with a maximum flow rate of 5.0 kgh−1 was produced with the solar steam generator. A small fraction (0.58 kgh−1) mixed with 10{\%} of H2 was supplied to a 12-cell solid oxide electrolyzer stack with approx. 2 kW electrical power. At 770 °C and a current density of −1.25 Acm−2 a steam conversion rate of 70{\%} at 93{\%} electrical electrolyzer efficiency was achieved.},

  ABSTRACT = {Reduction of acids to molecular hydrogen as a means of storing energy is catalyzed by platinum, but its low abundance and high cost are problematic. Precisely controlled delivery of protons is critical in hydrogenase enzymes in nature that catalyze hydrogen (H(2)) production using earth-abundant metals (iron and nickel). Here, we report that a synthetic nickel complex, [Ni(P(Ph)(2)N(Ph))(2)](BF(4))(2), (P(Ph)(2)N(Ph) = 1,3,6-triphenyl-1-aza-3,6-diphosphacycloheptane), catalyzes the production of H(2) using protonated dimethylformamide as the proton source, with turnover frequencies of 33,000 per second (s(-1)) in dry acetonitrile and 106,000 s(-1) in the presence of 1.2 M of water, at a potential of -1.13 volt (versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple). The mechanistic implications of these remarkably fast catalysts point to a key role of pendant amines that function as proton relays.},

  ABSTRACT = {Z-schematic water splitting was successfully demonstrated using metal sulfide photocatalysts that were usually unsuitable for water splitting as single particulate photocatalysts due to photocorrosion. When metal sulfide photocatalysts with a p-type semiconductor character as a H2-evolving photocatalyst were combined with reduced graphene oxide-TiO2 composite as an O2-evolving photocatalyst, water splitting into H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric amount proceeded. In this system, photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 with an n-type semiconductor character transferred to the metal sulfide through a reduced graphene oxide to achieve water splitting. Moreover, this system was active for solar water splitting.},

  ABSTRACT = {Alkaline water electrolysis is one of the easiest methods for hydrogen production, offering the advantage of simplicity. The challenges for widespread use of water electrolysis are to reduce energy consumption, cost and maintenance and to increase reliability, durability and safety. This literature review examines the current state of knowledge and technology of hydrogen production by water electrolysis and identifies areas where R{\&}D effort is needed in order to improve this technology. Following an overview of the fundamentals of alkaline water electrolysis, an electrical circuit analogy of resistances in the electrolysis system is introduced. The resistances are classified into three categories, namely the electrical resistances, the reaction resistances and the transport resistances. This is followed by a thorough analysis of each of the resistances, by means of thermodynamics and kinetics, to provide a scientific guidance to minimising the resistance in order to achieve a greater efficiency of alkaline water electrolysis. The thermodynamic analysis defines various electrolysis efficiencies based on theoretical energy input and cell voltage, respectively. These efficiencies are then employed to compare different electrolysis cell designs and to identify the means to overcome the key resistances for efficiency improvement. The kinetic analysis reveals the dependence of reaction resistances on the alkaline concentration, ion transfer, and reaction sites on the electrode surface, the latter is determined by the electrode materials. A quantitative relationship between the cell voltage components and current density is established, which links all the resistances and manifests the importance of reaction resistances and bubble resistances. The important effect of gas bubbles formed on the electrode surface and the need to minimise the ion transport resistance are highlighted. The historical development and continuous improvement in the alkaline water electrolysis technology are examined and different water electrolysis technologies are systematically compared using a set of the practical parameters derived from the thermodynamic and kinetic analyses. In addition to the efficiency improvements, the needs for reduction in equipment and maintenance costs, and improvement in reliability and durability are also established. The future research needs are also discussed from the aspects of electrode materials, electrolyte additives and bubble management, serving as a comprehensive guide for continuous development of the water electrolysis technology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
