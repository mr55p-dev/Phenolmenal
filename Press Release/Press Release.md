A recent paper released by a team at the University of Nottingham suggests that there is still a bright future for the use of hydrogen as a fuel.
Authors have reviewed the de facto hydrogen production methods and evaluated some promising new methods which offer several benefits; these emerging technologies have the potential to become major sources of fuel in the future.

The hydrogen fuel cell is a device which reacts hydrogen (H~2~) as a fuel and oxygen (O~2~) from the atmosphere to release energy.
Unlike the current conventional fuels, this process is extremely clean and generates only water and energy as it's products. 
Reducing CO~2~ output is a promise of what has been called the "hydrogen economy".

>"The hydrogen economy has only failed until now because of the lack of a clean reliable way to generate hydrogen at scale. This problem is something we felt that needed to be addressed; there's a large body of active research out there and this review showcases some ways we can achieve this goal." - E. Lunnon, author.

The paper explains that there are currently methods for producing hydrogen however these processes are environmentally unfriendly, steam methane reforming being an example wherein steam and methane are reacted together in a process which leads to the release of both CO and CO~2~. If scaled up to meet the demands of a hydrogen powered country these processes would lead to a net increase in the release of emissions, which is not a sustainable solution.

>"There are many novel techniques being developed out there which have the potential to bridge the gap between the novel methods and actual production at scale. We've found that the water splitting reactions in particular show major upsides compared to SMR for example." - W. Ogle, author.

Instead the paper looks at novel methods which show promise on the scale of experiments, which are carbon neutral or which will not release CO~2~ in the same way.
One such example is the process of electrically splitting water molecules into their composite gasses H~2~ and O~2~ using a cobalt based catalyst.
This reaction is clean and the catalyst can be generated inexpensively which are both important factors.


By investing in these methods and developing them further it is hoped that the gap between research and commercialisation of this technology can be bridged, leading to a potentially carbon-neutral and naturally abundant fuel source to help power civilisation for generations to come.
