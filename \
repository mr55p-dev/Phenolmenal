\subsection{Thermal Decomposition.}%
\label{sub:thermal_decomposition_methane_decomp_revised_}
\cite{CDM}
In this 2001 paper the researchers looked at various \ce{Fe-M} catalysts for the production of \ce{H2} gas by means of the thermal decomposition of methane.
The metals used for the \ce{M} part of the \ce{Fe-M} catalyst were \ce{Pd}, \ce{Mo} and \ce{Ni}.
The catalysts were synthesised by adding a solution of \ce{(Fe(NO3)3.9H2O)} and the appropriate salt for \ce{M (Pd(NO3)2.xH2O}, \ce{Ni(NO3)2.6H2O)}, and \ce{(NH4)6Mo7O24)} to a slurry of $\gamma$-alumina and then increasing the pH of the solution with ammonia which caused the catalysts to precipitate out.
The precipitate was washed with water and dried forming pellets around \SI{1.5 x 4.0}{\milli\meter}.
The researchers flowed \SI{10}{\milli\liter\per\minute} of methane over \SI{1}{\gram} of catalyst and measured the percent volume of hydrogen produced using a gas chromatograph.

The researchers compared the proportion of hydrogen evolved using a pure \ce{Fe} catalyst, a pure \ce{M} catalyst, a mixture of \ce{Fe} and \ce{M} catalyst and no catalyst for each of the \ce{Fe-M} catalysts.
For Molybdenum a mixture of \SI{0.5}{\percent} \ce{Mo} and \SI{4.5}{\percent} \ce{Fe} produced the best evolution rate at the lowest temperature with a rate of ~\SI{85}{\percent} at \SI{700}{\celsius}, with the best pre-treatment being carburised rather than oxidised or reduced.
The same is true for palladium where the mixed catalyst produced \SI{90}{\percent} hydrogen at ~\SI{870}{\celsius}.
For \ce{Ni} the pure \ce{Ni} catalyst shows better results than the \ce{Ni-Fe} catalyst at temperatures up to ~\SI{650}{\celsius}, but then declines significantly at higher temperatures.
Therefore, the catalyst of mixture \SI{0.5}{\percent} \ce{Ni} and \SI{4.5}{\percent} \ce{Fe} had its highest evolution rate at the lowest temperature with \SI{90}{\percent} evolution at ~\SI{800}{\celsius}.

The researchers then compared the results from the mixed catalysts to each other as well as pure \ce{Fe} catalyst and no catalyst results.
They found that there was a “substantial decrease in decomposition temperature” when using mixed catalysts compared with no catalysts.
The researchers also found that whilst \ce{M=Pd} had a better hydrogen evolution rate at lower temperatures the results for all three binary catalysts were similar at \SIrange{700}{800}{\celsius} with all three catalysts producing around a \SI{90}{\percent} evolution rate, though \ce{Pd} does have at slightly higher maximum evolution at ~\SI{900}{\celsius}.

An advantage of this method is that it presents a clear improvement over using simple \ce{Fe}, \ce{Ni}, \ce{Pd} and \ce{Mo} catalysts with substantially reduced decomposition temperatures and an improved evolution rate.
This method also does not necessarily require the use of rare noble metals, although \ce{Pd} can be used with the \ce{Fe} it has little difference in evolution temperature with using \ce{Ni} or \ce{Mo}.
A disadvantage is that the reaction has not been scaled up, with a catalyst bed of only \SI{3}{\gram} being used.
Another issue is that the reaction uses methane, which is largely obtained via fossil fuels.
Asubsection name final issue is that the catalyst can suffer from decay, although this is less problematic at higher amounts of catalyst.

\subsection{Radical chain reactions}%
\label{sub:radical_chain_reactions}

Radical methane pyrolysis is a way of breaking a \ce{CH4} molecule into \ce{H2} and pure carbon.
The initial step is the chemisorption of \ce{CH4}, onto the surface of the catalyst.

\begin{align}
	\intertext{The initiation and rate determining step of the radical break down is:}
	\ce{CH4&-> ^.CH3 + H^.}
	\intertext{Then a series of propagation steps take place with the general equation:}
	\ce{^.CH_{n}&-> ^.CH_{n-1} + H^.}
	\intertext{Until a termination step is reached:}
	\ce{4H^.&-> 2H2}
	\intertext{This gives the overall equation of:}
	\ce{CH4&-> C + 2H2}
.\end{align}

This reaction mechanism gives rise to no waste gases such as \ce{CO2} but does has the issue of elemental carbon production which can lead to the degradation of the catalyst as carbon is deposited upon the catalyst surface.
The reaction conditions for this mechanism follow Le Chatelier’s principal.
As the reaction is endothermic a high temperature is needed, as there are more moles on the RHS, low pressure is needed.
This is very expensive to maintain.
The methane should also move at a low velocity as increases the contact efficiency between the methane and the catalyst, this results in a higher quantity of methane being adsorbed on the active site of the catalyst which means the catalyst will deteriorate slower.
Various catalysts can be used from metals, molten salts/ metals, or carbon-based catalysts.
The main catalysts in a metal catalysed reaction are nickel and iron, these are particularly useful as a partially filled \ce{3d} orbitals accept electrons from the \ce{CH} bonds destabilising their bond strength.
These metals allow carbon diffusion through the crystalline structure.
Table \ref{tab:catalystTable} shows a few key aspects of the catalysts and how they affect the operating conditions and overall reaction process.

Both supported and non-supported iron catalysts have been tested such as: \ce{[Fe(CO)5]},  \ce{[Fe(cp)2]}.
However, these types of clusters can give result in unwanted gases, meaning the \ce{H2} must be separated from the gaseous mixture.
A catalyst with a strong support increases the carbon dispersion and reducibility of the metal along with preventing sintering of metal particles.
However, an excessively strong support may hamper the reducibility of metal oxides.
A supported catalyst has a better performance as it balances the carbon dispersion resulting in a longer lasting catalyst while maintaining the reducibility of the metal species.
There are three types of carbon catalyst highly ordered, less ordered, and disordered.
Disordered carbon catalysts have three valence sites or no coordination sites these are known as high energy sites (HES).
The more HES’s there are the faster the rate as these are thought to initiate the mechanism.
More oxygenated catalysts have a higher activity but release \ce{COx}, this is because as \ce{COx} is produced new active sites are created on the surface of the catalyst.


\subsection{Methane Pyrolysis}%
\label{sub:methane_pyrolysis}
This research is looking to use the \ce{H2} from methane decomposition to upcycle waste gases, such as \ce{CO2}, from industry:
\begin{align}
	\ce{CO2 + 3H2&-> \ce{CH3OH} + \ce{H2O}}
.\end{align}

For this, a steady stream of \ce{H2} gas is needed, which simply cannot be provided by water electrolysis due to the reasons outlined previously.
Methane pyrolysis has an enthalpy of reaction ($\Delta_RH$) of \SI{+37.5}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}, while the electrolysis of water has a $\Delta_RH$ of \SI{+268}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}, making methane decomposition more thermodynamically favourable than the electrolysis of water.
Methane pyrolysis occurs via a free radical dissociation reaction, involving one of a selection of catalysts available.
The initial step is the chemisorption of methane onto the catalytic surface.


This reaction mechanism gives rise to no waste gases such as \ce{CO2} but does has the issue of elemental carbon production which can lead to the degradation of the catalyst as carbon is deposited upon the catalyst surface (catalytic poisoning).

Iron can also be used as a catalyst, its catalytic activity is lower than that of nickel and cobalt, however it is more resistant catalytic deactivation.
This is because carbon has higher rate of diffusion in iron, meaning it does not deposit itself upon the active site of the catalyst.
It also has the advantage of being able to operate at high temperatures \SIrange{700}{1000}{\celsius} 
It is also cheaper and less toxic than nickel and cobalt catalysts.

Both supported and non-supported iron catalysts have been tested such as: \ce{[Fe(CO)5]}, \ce{[Fe(cp)2]}.
However, these types of clusters can give result in unwanted gases meaning the \ce{H2} has to be separated from the gaseous mixture.

A supported catalyst has a better performance as it balances the carbon dispersion resulting in a longer lasting catalyst while maintaining the reducibility of the metal species.

Ni-Pd or \ce{Ni-Cu} can be used as a catalyst promoter; they have high lattice constants meaning they have a high capacity for waste carbon build up meaning they are longer living catalysts.
While these alloys are longer lasting, they have a lower rate of reaction.
The palladium or copper in the alloy serve as dopants, helping to initiate the hydrogen spill over effect.

Metal catalysts have reduced performance as the reaction progresses as the active sites becomes encapsulated by elemental carbon, therefore carbon-based catalysts should be considered.
These catalysts need higher operating temperatures have lower catalytic activity but are lower cost, have a high resistance to temperature and have a high stability, do not deposit toxic materials into the carbon by-product, tolerate impurities in the reaction such as sulphur and produce zero \ce{CO2} emissions as the catalyst doesn’t need to be regenerated.

There are three types of carbon catalyst; highly ordered, less ordered, and disordered.
Disordered carbon catalysts have free valence sites or coordination sites these are known as high energy sites (HES).
The more \ce{HES}’s there are the faster the rate, as these are thought to initiate the mechanism.
More oxygenated catalysts have a higher activity but release \ce{COx}.

This is because as \ce{COx} is produced new active sites are created on the surface of the catalyst.
The reaction mechanisms for many of these carbon catalysts are not known.
